<h4>Viva's self-professed 'Veganorak' Kat Himmel takes the strain out of cruelty-free product spotting!</h4>

  There are  some wonderful people out there who work tirelessly to bring lovely, healthy  and innovative products to the vegans of the UK. Laura McComiskie, founder of  Love the Planet toiletries (cult product must-have: Washable Cleansing Pads,  £5.95 for a pack of five from the Viva! Shop), has recently extended her  expertise to mineral makeup with the launch of BM Beauty. I’m a veteran in this  field, having tried countless brands in the past – none of which performed even  remotely as well as these products do. The foundation does not settle into the  pores on the face and draw unwanted attention to your imperfections. It stays  put and lends a lovely glow. Ditto the eyeshadows, resplendently metallic with  magnificent staying power and none of that ‘retreating into the creases’  malarkey. The lip gloss? It’s honestly the best I’ve used – and I am a  self-professed lip gloss strumpet. The colours are subtle, but not tacky or too  glaringly glossy.  They’re perfect for  layering over stain or lippie. Affordably-priced at £7-8 for eye shadows and  concealers to £14 for the synthetic makeup brushes, buy from Viva!’s online  shop (<a href="http://www.vivashop.org.uk">www.vivashop.org.uk</a>) and help us help animals!</p>
<p><strong>Giveaway!</strong><br />
    <strong>Too late for the party season, but don’t  let that stop you. The generous folks at BM Beauty are offering one grand prize  winner a selection of the full range of products. Four others will win a lip  gloss and an eyeshadow. Send your name, address and colour preferences to: Good  Slap Giveaway, 8 York Court, Wilder St, Bristol BS2 8QH or email  kat@viva.org.uk with “Good Slap” in subject. Closing date January 30, 2012.</strong></p><hr style="color: #fff; background-color: #fff; border: 3px dotted #cccccc; border-style: none none dotted; clear:both;">

  I  recently adopted two gorgeous moggies and, as it has been a long while since my  husband and I have shared our home with more than one kitteh at a time, we were  not prepared for the pong. I know it’s not their fault, but I really needed to  rectify the situation as the resident pooch was complaining! One day, during a  particularly fraught and frantic attempt to find an effective solution, I  stumbled upon the website, Natural &amp; Clean (<a href="http://www.naturalandclean.com">www.naturalandclean.com</a>). I promptly ordered a six litre bag of  their cat litter and I will never look back. Odious odours promptly exited as  soon as I replaced the useless paper-based litter. Heavenly! We could all  breathe again and the canine companion retracted his emancipation demands.  Slightly more expensive at £6.65 per bag, it is, nonetheless, highly economical  for one or two cats. Check out the rest of their range at their website or  Ocada (www.ocada.com).</p>
<p><strong>Giveaway!</strong><br />
    <strong>We’re giving the full range of 12 Natural  &amp; Clean products to one winner, whilst some other lucky devil will win one  of each product from the pet care line.</strong><strong> Send your name, address  and skin type to: Natural &amp; Clean Giveaway, 8 York Court, Wilder St,  Bristol BS2 8QH or email kat@viva.org.uk with “Natural &amp; Clean” in subject.  Closing date January 30, 2012.</strong></p><hr style="color: #fff; background-color: #fff; border: 3px dotted #cccccc; border-style: none none dotted; clear:both;">
